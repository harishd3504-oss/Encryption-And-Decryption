## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. User provides text (or file input)
2. Text is encrypted using a basic algorithm
3. Encrypted data is saved to a file
4. Same logic is used to decrypt and retrieve original text

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is for learning purposes and does not use advanced cryptographic standards.
